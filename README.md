2024 Spring ENGR 1050 Final Project

# How to Run: 
*Option 1*

Download the .zip file “ENGR 1050 Final Project” and upload it to Google Drive. On Colab, run the first and second blocks of code. This will unzip this zip file. Change endLoc in the second block of code as desired.

You will need to change realTimeData (block 3 line 8), stops (block 3 line 9), and bullet (line 143) in the main code file depending on your file directory arrangement. 

Note that this program takes around 10-13 minutes to complete. Google Colab has a tendency to disconnect the runtime at random, so if this occurs while running the program, you may need to rerun it.

# Summary
For this project, we analyzed data provided by the MTA for the New York City Subway. The MTA provides real time data, as to the positions of trains in the system, and various sources collect this data. We were able to gain access to the data collected for all the trains in the system on Monday, February 19th, 2024 (which we can treat as a “typical” weekday). With this data, we set out to explore three main ideas. Firstly, we wanted to visually understand the paths of trains as they traveled through the system during morning and evening rush hours; this could lead to qualitative insights as to where trains tend to terminate, whether trains run express vs. local on a certain line, or where choke points tend to occur that could lead to cascading delays. Secondly, we sought to explore the distribution of interval times for each line (we define an interval time to be the time between trains of a certain line at a certain station—to take the distribution of these interval times for a specific line, we combine all the interval times for all the stations on that line). We wanted to explore how different lines have similar or different interval time distributions using statistical testing. Finally, using the median of interval time distributions as a loose quantitative measure of line performance, we wanted to rank train lines based on the median of their interval time distributions. We also wanted to come up with the average wait time for each line (which is found by averaging the interval time distribution if it is assumed that subway lines behave as a Poisson distribution).

For the first part of my program, we imported two CSV files as pandas dataframes. One contained the stop times for each trip a train took. This dataframe displayed the train ID, when that train stopped at a given station, when it left that station, and so on for all the stations in that trip. It collected this data for all train trips of all the NYC Subway lines on this arbitrarily chosen date. The other CSV file contained the stop ID for all stations in the NYC subway system and data relating to that stop ID, including the street name of that stop. We set the directories referring to these files as global variables. For each trunk line (color in the subway system), we then ran trainPlot to gain a plot of the paths of trains as they traveled north and south through the system during morning and evening rush hours. After this, we created histograms displaying the train interval distribution for all the number lines (known as the IRT) and all of the letter lines (known as the IND or BMT) separately. We ran statistical tests on the distributions at a given rush hour time and with a given direction (north or south) for each line and obtained a dictionary of Shapiro-Wilk test p-values, an ANOVA test p-value, a boolean indicating whether the set of data we provided was all normal or not, and a dataframe containing the pairwise two sample t-test or Mann-Whitney U test p-val (depending on whether all the data are normally distributed or not). We inputted this dataframe into the makeHeatmap function in order to create a logarithmically-scaled heatmap of pairwise p-values. Finally, we printed the mean wait times for each line as a dictionary and ran boxAndWhisker to generate a box and whisker plot for each line ordered from smallest median interval time to largest median interval time.
	
We fulfilled computation through extensive filtering and manipulations of the imported CSV file (which involved filtering by time of day, querying by line, the conversion of HH:MM:SS time into time in just seconds), scaling of my plots to ensure that they all had the same size regardless of the number of plots on each figure, creating a distribution that collected the seconds between trains at a station during a specified time of day, logarithmic scaling of the heatmap of pairwise p-values (to make it easier to read), and the calculation of the mean and five number summary for each line’s time interval distribution. 

For statistics, we performed various analyses, including a Shapiro-Wilk Test to determine normality, an ANOVA Test, and pairwise Mann-Whitney U Test/Two Sample t Test depending on the normality of the distributions. We also collected a five number summary for each line’s time interval distribution and calculated a mean.

For data visualization, we created a line plot for each line, time of day, and direction to show the path train lines took as they traveled from their origin to their terminus. In this plot, we added the image of each train bullet to the title as well as the stop names on the y-axis instead of the internal values we assigned to them. We also created various histograms displaying time interval distributions as well as a boxplot ranking train lines from least to greatest median time interval distribution and giving a better comparison of time interval distributions between lines. In this latter visualization, we was able to color each boxplot by the color corresponding to the train line.

# Simplifications and Assumptions
One major assumption was that each station should be weighed equally when calculating the time interval distribution. Although this makes sense, it is also important to also take into account the passenger volume at each station; if more people take the train from Times Square compared to Far Rockaway-Mott Av, the weightage of time between trains at Times Square should take precedence over the weightage of time between trains at Far Rockaway. This is especially important because some trains short turn before reaching their terminus, making stations in the middle of their paths have more frequent service than stations at the ends of their paths.
 
This project also assumes that individuals are waiting for a specific line when in reality, various lines can bring an individual from their station of origin to their desired destination; thus, wait times are not necessarily an accurate reflection of how long a passenger need wait to get from their origin to destination. 

Another simplification made was that the time between trains at a station is an accurate proxy of wait time. This assumes that all passengers enter the station right after the previous train leaves. More mathematically intricate calculations will need to be performed to get a better estimate of wait time. 

One exclusion from this project was the shuttle lines, as they contained so few stops that any information that could be gleaned from them was extremely minimal. The Staten Island Railway was also ignored as it functionally serves more as suburban rail compared to rapid transit.

# Observations
Based on the visualizations of train trips during morning and evening rush hour, we determined that 
- Several (1) train trips begin at 238 St (so that they can short turn to the yard between 238 St and 241 St) and 137 St. The (4) train is also seen short turning before its terminus at Woodlawn at Burnside Av and bedford Pk Blvd
- (2) and (5) trains seem to have delays around E 180 St and Rogers Jct (between Franklin Av and President St), both of which are known chokepoints. We know there are delays because the slope for certain trips is much flatter than for other trips.
- The (N) train sometimes runs local, despite its normal route in Manhattan (can be spotted by the one or two yellow lines crossing every other line instead of running roughly parallel). (W) frequency is very low, but is supplemented by (N) train (considered an alternative of the (N)).
- The two (F) peak express trains in Brooklyn can be spotted (crossing over other (F) trains) 
- (M) train frequency has dropped significantly compared to usual as it is not running on Queens Blvd

In the heatmaps, certain p values were extremely small and thus rounded to 0. When performing a logarithmic scaling, 0 maps to negative infinity, which messes up dataframe filtering and visualization, so all squares that had a p value of 0 before logarithmic scaling were just assigned a black square with no label.
